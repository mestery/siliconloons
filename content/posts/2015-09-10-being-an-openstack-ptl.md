My good friend [Flavio Percoco][1] published an excellent
[blog post][2] recently about what it means to be an OpenStack PTL from
his perspective. Having served as OpenStack Neutron PTL for 3 cycles now, I
found his post very timely and it accurately reflects what I believe
anyone wanting to run for an OpenStack PTL position should consider before
making the decision to run.

The post is so well written it's hard for me to quote a single part, but
I'll try here:

>> Before even start writing your candidacy, please, ask yourself why you
>> want to be a PTL. What is it that you want to bring to the project that
>> is good for both, the project and the community. You don't really need
>> to get stuck on this question forever, you don't really need to bring
>> something new to the project.

Absolutely important and often overlooked, as a future PTL, make sure you ask
yourself why you want to be a PTL. If the first answer isn't something along
the lines of wanting to help the community, you may want to reconsider.

>> What I'm trying to say is that you should sit down and think of what your
>> next 6 months will look like time-wise. I believe it's safe enough to say
>> that you'll have to spend 60% to 70% of your time upstream, assuming the

I disagree with Flavio a bit here. Rather than 60-70% of your time, I would
argue being a PTL requires 110% of your time. It's an exhausting job that will
envelope your life for 6 months. Be prepared for the enormous of time it will
take, at all of hours of the day, on weekends, holidays (nothing is country
specific in OpenStack), time with family and friends, etc. It's very rewarding
but very exhausting at the same time.

Overall, a great read by Flavio. I highly encourage you to read the full article.
