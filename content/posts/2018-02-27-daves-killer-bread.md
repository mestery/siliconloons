Excerpt from a great [article][1] by [Tove K. Danovich][2] over at
[The Ringer][3]:

> When Dave Dahl looks at those bread packages, what he sees is what we all
> see: a freshly transformed ex-con ready to leave the past behind him and
> has created a product that people don’t just like but adore. He was a
> literal poster child for breaking through a sordid past and finding success.
> He worked more hours a week than he could count and shook hands and smiled
> when people approached him on his days off. Then the real Dave disappeared
> from public life while his caricature appeared in more and more aisles
> across the country.

Having been a long-time fan of Dave's Killer Bread, I found this article quite
fascinating. Not only is the backstory on Dave amazing, his current endeavor
and his passion for each of the stops in his life is fascinating:

> “One thing about this place is if it fails, it’s going to fail big time,”
> Dave says. Even if it does, it will just become one more chapter in his
> story — available for anyone to take or leave. Dave has spent the past few
> chapters struggling to be a better person, to put some good back in the
> world to make up for what he’s taken out of it. The masks have helped Dave
> reclaim what he lost when he gave his face away to the company he founded.
> Behind those hundreds of faces — time-weathered, intricate, strong — that’s
> where you’ll find the real Dave.
