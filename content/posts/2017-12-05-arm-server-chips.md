From an [article][1] from [The Next Platform][2] site:

> The Centriq 2400 is the culmination of over four years of work and
> investment, which according to the experts in the semiconductor
> industry we have talked to, easily took on the order of $100 million to $125
> million to make happen ­– remember there was a prototype as well as the
> first generation Amberwing chip – and probably several hundred chip
> engineers to design. And now, there is another credible Arm server processor
> in the datacenter fray alongside the ThunderX and ThunderX-2 from Cavium and
> the X-Gene 1 and X-Gene 2 from Applied Micro.

2018 and beyond is shaping up to be a very interesting time for the server chip
market. Couple this with Red Hat Enterprise Linux for ARM (see a great article
from Jon Masters [here][3]), and I can't wait for what is next.
