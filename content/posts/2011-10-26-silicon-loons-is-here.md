So, you&#8217;ve somehow stumbled onto Silicon Loons, and you may be wondering what exactly this place is. Let me summarize it for you by saying we at Silicon Loons hope to share ourÂ experiences with virtualization, networking, storage, and telecommuting. We&#8217;ve done some fun things over the years, and thought it was time to start sharing with a broader audience. So stay tuned for the fun to follow.

Oh, and you may be thinking why the Loons part? Is it because the authors are crazy? That may be, but in reality, we are just 4 guys from the Great North in Minnesota. For more reference, check out our [state bird][1].

So, we hope to get some content going on this site soon. Until then, stay warm!
