A quick note that I've changed my blog over to using [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/) now from Wordpress.
The process itself was quite easy, and this now allows me to host the blog itself whereever I want.
I'm still playing with the process itself, but I'm finding the ability to blog using "vi" and save
using github is already a huge win.
