I've been the OpenStack Neutron for 3 releases in a row. I started in Juno,
was re-elected for Kilo, and then again for Liberty. This time, I'm [no
longer running][1] to be the Neutron PTL anymore. I am really proud of what
the team has accomplished while I was the PTL. I'm proud of not only the
technical achievements, but also the community building and societal changes
Neutron has undergone. All of this was accomplished with the help of some
amazing people who likely spent as much time ensuring Neutron was a healthy
place for new developers as they did fixing bugs and adding features. (Note
to those who were a part of this: It was all worth it, and everyone new to
Neutron thanks you for your efforts over the past one and a half years).

One thing which has really crystallized for me during my time as PTL is how
important it is to always treat people with respect and integrity. It's easy
to sit behind a computer and forget there are actual human beings behind the
bug report you're reading when it doesn't have enough information or when the
gerrit review you're staring at lacks unit tests. But as Open Source developers
and more importantly as human beings ourselves, we can't forget the bug report
was filed by someone who is trying to help, or the code review was maybe
submitted by a first time contributor. At the end of the day, we're all people
who are engaging with other people. Respect and integrity are what keep the
system moving smoothly. They allow the web of trust Open Source relies on to
be effective.

While I may be gone from the PTL role in Neutron, I plan to remain engaged in
the Neutron and OpenStack communities. I'm confident the next PTL will be
someone amazing, because Neutron has a deep bench of leadership and a community
which will welcome a new PTL and work together to make that person effective. I
look forward to what amazing things are to come for OpenStack and Neutron.
