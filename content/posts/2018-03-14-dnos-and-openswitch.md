This, from an [AT&T press release][1] at the end of January:

> AT&T* is working to provide the industry with a more open, flexible and
> cost-effective alternative to traditional integrated networking equipment.
> We intend to open source a project that we call the Disaggregated Network
> Operating System, or dNOS, hosted by The Linux Foundation.

So far so good. *Another* network operating system, which is also open
source, but I'm following along.

Then this:

> “The Linux Foundation welcomes the dNOS project to the open source
> community," said Arpit Joshipura, general manager of Networking, The Linux
> Foundation. "The dNOS project will help create a network operating system
> community that will benefit existing Linux Foundation projects like
> FRRouting and OpenSwitch, and pave the way for future projects to help
> drive innovation at the lower layers of the network stack.”

How will *another* open source networking community, ostensibly shoved into the
open by a single incumbent, benefit existing communities? AT&T would have been
better in just collaborating with [OpenSwitch][2] rather than creating another
open source network operating system. Similar to what [Google did][3] with
[Stratum][4] this week, the market is becoming flooded with open source
network operating systems, all based on Linux, and all pushing a specific
agenda from their previous owners. It's becoming confusing and it isn't
helping anyone at this point.
