This is just a quick post to note that the devstack support for OpenDaylight was <a title="OpenDaylight Helium support for devstack" href="https://review.openstack.org/#/c/128937/" target="_blank">recently updated</a> to use the <a title="OpenDaylight Helium" href="http://www.opendaylight.org/blogs/2014/09/open-open-open-opendaylight-helium-here" target="_blank">Helium release</a> of OpenDaylight. For anyone who wants to pull down devstack and have it spin-up Neutron with OpenDaylight, you will now get the latest and greatest OpenDaylight release as a part of this. My <a title="OpenDaylight with OpenStack Neutron" href="http://www.siliconloons.com/opendaylight-integration-with-openstack-has-merged-into-icehouse/" target="_blank">blog post</a> on how to use this is still relevant, so if you&#8217;re looking for instructions please look there.

Happy SDN&#8217;ing!
