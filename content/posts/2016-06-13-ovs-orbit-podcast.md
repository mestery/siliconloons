I recently had the honor of being on the [OVS Orbit][1] podcast. Ben Pfaff
has been doing these shows for a short time, and I was happy to join him and
discuss [open source development processes][2] as they relate to Open Source
networking projects.

One key note which Ben calls out is something I firmly believe in, and wanted
to quote and paste below:

> Kyle's advice: plan ahead, research the projects, give your developers time to
> become comfortable with the projects, treat everyone with respect, treat
> everyone equally, and give back to the core of the project. Keep in mind that
> little maintenance patch are as important as huge new features. Finally, trust
> your developers: you hired good people, so trust their ability to work upstream. 

Thanks for having me on the show [Ben][3]!
