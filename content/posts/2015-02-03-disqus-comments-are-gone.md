I chose to remove [Disqus](https://disqus.com/) comments from my blog. After reading about all the issues around the
[tracking](http://blog.irukado.org/2013/12/disqus-considered-harmful/)
and [privacy concerns](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disqus#Criticism_and_privacy_concerns), I just decided it wasn't worth it
for my users. So the best way to comment on this blog going forward is through Social Media outlets. I'll keep looking for a
better option, but for now, that's what I can offer.
