Subject stolen from the eloquent <a title="Paris Lemon" href="http://parislemon.com/" target="_blank">MG Siegler</a>, who writes <a title="Comments Are Bile" href="http://parislemon.com/post/15288210624/comments-still-off" target="_blank">here</a>Â about his feelings on comments on blog posts. I have to say, I agree 100% with him. I&#8217;ve spent way too much time trolling spam comments over the last few months. I realized it&#8217;s just not worth it. Like MG says, anyone who wants to respond to a post on this site can do so by contacting me on <a title="mestery" href="http://twitter.com/mestery" target="_blank">twitter</a>.
