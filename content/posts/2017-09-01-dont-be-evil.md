Some notes on Google using it's search monopoly to quash ideas it does
not like from [this][1] article by [Kashmir Hill][2]:

This is nothing new, for sure. And it's not only Google, I'm sure any of the
current Internet silos we all live in do the same. Their reliance on locking
people in means they make self-serving decisions which are against the
interests of their users. All the more reason to support research from groups
like [Citizens Against Monopoly][3].

Note, the updated note from a Google VP of communications is worth reading at the
end, as well. Always interesting to see how the companies with built-in
monopolies respond when poked about their monopolies.
