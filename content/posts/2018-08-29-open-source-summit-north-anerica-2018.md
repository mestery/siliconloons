This week I was fortunate to attend the [Open Source Summit in Vancouver](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/open-source-summit-north-america-2018/). I was only here for a few days, and was particularly interested in the [Cloud Native NFV Workshop](http://sched.co/FAWY). This aligns with the work we're doing around [Network Service Mesh](https://www.networkservicemesh.io/) and we even got to talk about NSM at this event. It was exciting to see people understand why we're building NSM. Fun times ahead this fall.
