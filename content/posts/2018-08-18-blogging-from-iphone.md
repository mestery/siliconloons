I'm writing this post from my iPhone using the awesome program [Working Copy](https://workingcopyapp.com). I found the basic workflow for this from a [blog post](http://evanbrown.io/post/hugo-on-the-go/) from Evan Brown and it works great!

Given my desire to own more of my own content and remove myself from centralized (and even decentralized) social sites, I'm hoping mobile blogging allows me some flexibility here to post on the go.
