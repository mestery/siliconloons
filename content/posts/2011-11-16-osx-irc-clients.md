I&#8217;ve recently started attending IRC meetings. Since I run a Mac, I had to do some digging to understand the best possible IRC clients out there. Fairly quickly, I discovered <a title="LimeChat" href="http://limechat.net/mac/" target="_blank">LimeChat</a>. It&#8217;s a very versatile IRC client, the UI is pretty clean, and it doesn&#8217;t appear to suck a ton of resources. Overall, I&#8217;m quite happy with it, and would recommend it for anyone looking for a slick IRC client on the Mac. Check it out either at the website above, or in the <a title="LimeChat in Mac App Store" href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/limechat/id414030210?mt=12" target="_blank">Mac App Store</a>.
