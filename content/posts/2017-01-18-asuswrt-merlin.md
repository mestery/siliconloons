I recently made the decision to invest in a home WiFi router which could
provide a VPN client right from the router for my home. Having in the past
been a huge fan of Asus routers, and currently owning a [Netgear Nighthawk][1]
router, I made the decision to move back to Asus. I acquired an
[Asus RT-AC88U][2]. I did this because it has a beefy dual-core Arm CPU, 512MB
of RAM, and even better, a community has developed around adding a few
additional features to it without requiring DD-WRT or OpenWRT.

This community is [ASUSWRT-MERLIN][3]. From the webpage:

> Asuswrt-Merlin is an alternative, custom version of that firmware.
> Developped by Eric Sauvageau, its primary goals are to enhance upon the
> existing firmware without bringing any radical changes, and to fix some of
> the known issues and limitations, while maintaining the same level of
> performance as the original firmware. This means Asuswrt-Merlin retains full
> support for NAT acceleration (sometimes referred to as "hardware
> acceleration"), enhanced NTFS performance (through the proprietary drivers
> used by Asus from either Paragon or Tuxera), and the Asus exclusive features
> such as AiCloud or the TrendMicro-powered AiProtection.  New feature addition
> is very low on the list of priorities in this project.

I recommend giving this a try if you're looking for something more than what is
provided out of the box from Asus. I'll detail my VPN setup in a future post.
