The [spring 2015 OpenStack TC elections][1] are underway right now. It's great to
see the number of candidates, 19 in all, who have the desire to help shape OpenStack
from the TC level. This shows there is still a real interest in being on the TC.
Each of the candidate's emails shows what they view as important and how they hope to
address the issues they deem relevant to the tasks at hand. I highly encourage you
to read all of these before voting.

I'm also encouraging you to think about a quote from [Maru Newby's candidacy
email][2]:

> ... and you are as frustrated with the status quo as I am, I hope you will
> consider voting for candidates that support the goal of building a more engaged
> TC focused on ensuring that participation in OpenStack becomes more enjoyable
> and sustainable.

Now go and vote!
