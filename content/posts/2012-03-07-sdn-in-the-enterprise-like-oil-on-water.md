This <a title="Why Many Networking Professionals Will Resist Software-Defined Networking" href="http://nerdtwilight.wordpress.com/2012/03/06/why-many-networking-professionals-will-resist-software-defined-networking/" target="_blank">post</a> by Brad Casemore is rather interesting. Specifically, I love this comment:

> When it comes to technologies and markets, our inherent optimism occasionally is thwarted by our intrinsic resistance to change.

This is true everywhere, but especially true in technology. I&#8217;m not saying SDN won&#8217;t penetrate the enterprise market, and neither is Brad. It will take time, for sure. What will help SDN penetrate this market is the <a title="Building Value with SDNs: RouteFlow" href="http://www.siliconloons.com/?p=36" target="_blank">value built on top of it</a>. Applications provide business value, and once they can orchestrate the network to their needs, the game changes. A good example is this post by Brad Hedlund on <a title="Understanding Hadoop Clusters and the Network" href="http://bradhedlund.com/2011/09/10/understanding-hadoop-clusters-and-the-network/" target="_blank">Hadoop Clusters and the Network</a>. Allowing a distributed piece of software like Hadoop to understand the network allows it to work more efficiently. This is an example of what will help to drive SDN adoption in the enterprise going forward.
