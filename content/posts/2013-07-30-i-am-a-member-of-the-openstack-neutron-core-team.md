So, it&#8217;s now official: I am a member of the OpenStack Neutron core team. I was <a title="New Neutron Core Members" href="http://lists.openstack.org/pipermail/openstack-dev/2013-July/012399.html" target="_blank">voted</a>Â onto the team last week and made <a title="OpenStack Neutron Meeting" href="http://eavesdrop.openstack.org/meetings/networking/2013/networking.2013-07-29-21.03.html" target="_blank">official</a> at the weekly Neutron meeting this past Monday. I will initially focus on the Open Source plugins (Open vSwitch, LinuxBridge) and the <a title="ML2 Wiki" href="https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Neutron/ML2" target="_blank">Modular Layer 2</a> (ML2) plugin. I wanted to thank Mark McClain for nominating me! The OpenStack Neutron core team is a great group of developers to work with, I&#8217;m very excited to continue contributing to OpenStack Neutron going forward!
