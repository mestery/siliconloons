Just a note that over the weekend, after a few weeks of reviews, the Open vSwitch Kernel Code has moved upstream. Dave Miller <a title="OVS Goes Upstream" href="http://lists.openwall.net/netdev/2011/12/04/6" target="_blank">pulled the code this weekend</a>. Getting this upstream will be really helpful for <a title="OpenStack Quantum" href="http://wiki.openstack.org/Quantum" target="_blank">OpenStack Quantum</a>, as the default plugin for that code uses OVS. This is also great for distributions who want to include OVS, but have been hesitant because of it&#8217;s lack of existence in the upstream kernel.

Congrats to the folks at <a title="Nicira" href="http://www.nicira.com/" target="_blank">Niciria</a> and others who worked hard over the last 3 years to make this milestone!
