# Hi there

My name is Kyle Mestery, and I'm a husband, a father, and a Distinguished
Engineer at Cisco. I love being being all of those things, even though
I'm so much more than those things separately.

I started [Silicon Loons](https://blog.siliconloons.com) in 2010 with
encouragement from my good friend and manager at the time, Mark Bakke.
I've continued to post sporadically as I can, and enjoy sharing content
and my own views on technology here.
